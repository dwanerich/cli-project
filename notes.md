WELCOME TO THE 1ST 3 APP.

IN THIS APP WE CALL ON A NY TIMES API WHICH RETURNS TO US COOL DATA.

BY A USER INPUTING A NEW CATEGORY, THE APP RETURNS THE 
TOP 3 STORIES OF ITS CATEGORY WITH THE OPTION TO GO A
FURTHER STEP DEEPER DISCOVERING A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE STORY AND IT'S
AUTHOR.

AT THIS POINT USER HAS THE OPTION TO EXPLORE OTHER CATEGORIES BY SIMPLY
TYPING THE CATEGORY NAME FOLLOWED BY "ENTER"

THIS SHOULD BE AN INFINITE CYCLE UNTIL THE USER DECIDES TO EXIT.
